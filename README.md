Youtube-Video-Chatbot
RAG application to interact with a you-tube video content Could you provide the video ID of the YouTube video you want to chat? Then, through the video ID, we will get the transcript of the whole video, then we will chunk it, create embeddings, and store it in the FIASS vector store. Whenever a query is received, retrieval from this vector store will be performed, and the retrieved content, along with the query, will be passed to the LLM with a prompt, yielding the output. The LLM model used is "gemini-2.5-flash". For embedding generation, we used "google/embeddinggemma-300m"
